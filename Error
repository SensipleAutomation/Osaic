Hi ‚Å†

Mathis,

 

Brian

, Good Morning, for the PR which is raised under https://pw1appdvop01.ibddomain.net/AdvisorGroup/Applications/_git/web/pullrequest/4311,  Regarding the "New_configuration (1).launch" filenames are not part of my changes and belong to another framework in the repository. My changes follow the project's naming conventions. 



As of this my PR is not merged, requesting for close the comment for merge..
