Good morning! I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to bring your attention to my pull request (PR) under https://pw1appdvop01.ibddomain.net/AdvisorGroup/Applications/_git/web/pullrequest/4311.

I've noticed comments related to the "New_configuration (1).launch" filenames. That these filenames aren't part of my changes; they belong to another framework in the repository. My modifications strictly adhere to the project's naming conventions.

Considering this clarification, I kindly request the closure of the comment for the PR merge.
