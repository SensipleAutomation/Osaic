Additionally, even after completing all the required actions and proceeding to the next step, the status of the previous step does not change to green. For instance, if a user completes Step 4 and moves on to Step 5, Step 4 should turn green to indicate successful completion. However, this visual feedback is not currently being reflected in the interface.
