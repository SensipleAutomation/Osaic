Click on the 'Yes' button.
Enter a valid ID in the opened text field.
Click the 'Save' button.
Click on the 'No' button.
Click the 'Save' button.
Once again, click on the 'Yes' button.
Observe that the previously entered ID is still present in the text field.
Expected Behaviour:
When the user switches from 'Yes' to 'No' and then back to 'Yes,' the previously entered FINRA ID should not be retained in the text field. The field should either be blank or reset to its default state.

Without refreshing the page or navigating away, attempt to enter a different phone number in the optional Personal Home Phone field.
Observe that the entered phone number in the Personal Home Phone field is incorrectly reflecting in the Personal Cell Phone field.
Expected Behaviour:
The data entered in the Personal Home Phone field should not overwrite or affect the data previously entered in the mandatory Personal Cell Phone field.

Actual Behaviour:
Entering data in the Personal Home Phone field results in the same data being reflected in the Personal Cell Phone field, causing a data integrity issue.

Steps to Reproduce:
Navigate to the section where the Business Street Address text field is present.

Observe that a validation prompt appears immediately upon clicking into the field, stating, "Please enter values."
Expected Behaviour:
Validation prompts should only occur when the user attempts to move away from the field or submits the form without entering required details. The error should not be triggered upon initially clicking into the field.
Actual Behaviour:
The validation prompt appears prematurely, even before any attempt to save or submit the form, hindering the user from entering values smoothly.

Pressing the "Enter" key after the initial opening of the form should not trigger the duplication of the +Location fields. The form should remain unchanged unless the user manually clicks the "+Location" button again.
Actual Behaviour:
Pressing the "Enter" key unintentionally triggers the opening of a new set of fields, causing unnecessary duplication.

Actual Behaviour:
The Save button remains enabled even after deleting unmodified fields within the +Location form, which may lead to confusion as it suggests unsaved changes.
